# Sprint retrospective - Loose ends and sprint mechanics, February 08, 2021 - February 26, 2021

## What worked
* We seem to finish 50-some story points per sprint with our reduced team.
* We find value in the standups because knowing what each other works on gives us possibility to help each other with the interruptduty workload and bus factor
* We're more and more confortable with using JIRA and its mechanics
* We're getting better at tracking interruptduty items

## What didn't
* We began this sprint with nearly 100 story points, then went to ~115. We ended up with 36 unfinished story points
* Tracking a busy interruptduty cycle may lead to bulky views and hard-to-track sprint board
* Still confusing as to what we're considering interruptduty. Are reviews and meetings part of that? If so, in what capacity?
* Some of the epics were very siloed. Wondering whether that's the right thing to do or not
* Ideally we don’t constantly run full speed but also have breathers

## Process changes for next sprint
* We're questioning whether we should continue adjusting items to the sprint or stay focused to the initial planning and drop anything else
* Wondering whether stricter sorting into “MVP” and “stretch goal” buckets could help with prioritizing items during the sprint
* Considering to avoid adding interruptduty items to the sprint, but add them to jira; there's a report for "non-sprint issues resolved during the sprint"
* Added “Blocked” column in the JIRA sprint for future iterations
* For sprint 5, we create a list of items, out of which we define the realistic set of the ones we think we can do so that we can make a better estimate
* Anything over a 1.5h maybe interruptduy worthy-ticket
* Epic champions should try to split up their proposed epics into story points, mvp vs stretch, before weds’ planning meeting
* Next review+retrospective meeting should be 1.5 hours :)
